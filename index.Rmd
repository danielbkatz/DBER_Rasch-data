# Introduction
This is meant to be a very general introduction for using the Rasch model to help construct measures and surveys in discipline based education research. This is meant to get you started but is by no means where you should stop. Please see the references section for where to go next. Please see, @WilsonMark2005 and @BondTrevor for more.
